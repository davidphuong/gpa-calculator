# GPA Calculator

A GPA Calculator written in C++.

## Background
Needed a way of quickly calculating my GPA score for a internship application so I decided to make a program to somewhat make the task easier. With this, I don't have to look up on how to calculate a GPA score everytime I need to calculate it.

## Installation
Firstly, you need to have `make` and `g++` installed. Then clone the application from GitHub and then make and run the app.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/davidphuong/gpa-calculator.git
$ cd gpa-calculator
$ make
$ ./gpa-calc
```

## Future Updates
* Pass in the University of Adelaide Access Adelaide generated academic transcript file and the program will automatically calculate your GPA score
* GUI version of the app written in Ruby on Rails and hosted on Heroku
